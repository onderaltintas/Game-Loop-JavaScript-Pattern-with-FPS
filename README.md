# Game-Loop-JavaScript-Pattern-with-FPS
Basic JavaScript Game Loop design pattern to just show the concept.

Don't have input part cause it is just to show how animation is done with gameloop.

Scope problems persist so givin class instance to loop (es5). Can be done with es6 as well. CBA to do it hehe.

Open to any updates if ye wanna work on it. 

Couldn't license with wtfpl but you can do whatever you want to do with codes here. 

Got basic part of this link, for further understanding you can read thiz (thanks to whoever wrote this):

You can change the fps just giving desired fps to class.

***To run:***
Just copy codes and paste it to chrome console.
